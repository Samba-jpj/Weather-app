# Weather App MVP Development

This repository contains the code and documentation for the Weather Application Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The app is designed to provide real-time weather updates for specific locations, leveraging Python and the OpenWeatherMap API.

## **MoSCoW Prioritization**

### **Must-Haves**
- Display current weather data for a user-specified location.
- Use OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather information.
- Input validation to handle invalid city names.
- Simple and user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) using `tkinter`.

### **Should-Haves**
- Error handling for network issues and failed API calls.
- Display additional weather details like humidity and wind speed.
- Responsive design for cross-platform compatibility.

### **Could-Haves**
- Option to save favorite cities for quick access.
- Multi-language support for international users.
- Temperature unit toggle (Celsius/Fahrenheit).
- Integration with other weather APIs for redundancy.

### **Wonâ€™t-Haves**
- Advanced analytics or weather predictions.
- Complex graphical designs or animations.
- Offline functionality.

## **Project Task Management**

### **To Do**
- Implement the input field for user-specified city names.
- Set up API calls to fetch weather data dynamically.
- Validate user inputs for errors (e.g., invalid city names).
- Document project setup and API integration steps.

### **In Progress**
- Debugging lag issues during API data retrieval.
- Enhancing error messages for better user feedback.
- Improving the responsiveness of the GUI.

### **Done**
- Integrated OpenWeatherMap API with API key for data retrieval.
- Created a basic Python application using `tkinter`.
- Designed a modular architecture for easy scalability.
- Added documentation for setup, usage, and known limitations.
